Since I have come on board, HG Skis has grown from a local favorite, to one of the up and coming craft ski brands of North America.

The final result would be done through the combination of public art pieces and park style features, publicly available in the same way a skatepark typically is. This would eliminate the need to take down the park in off season months.</p><p>The poster is a public invitation to the opening event at a hypothetical location in Burlington, Vermont. The booklet would act as a means of proposing the project to a new city with the aim of raising funding. The handmade process book covered all parts of the project from idea development and sketching, to final outcomes.</p>",
