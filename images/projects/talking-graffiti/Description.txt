I met up with Castle during my 5 month study in Wellington, New Zealand. Coming from South Africa, Ivan has an interesting background that forms his perspectives and pieces to be unlike any I've really seen before. There is a great array of graffiti style artwork in the area, and much of it coming from his crew, Pirates. It was great to get to talk and paint with an artist of the area and see how perspectives on art like this change country to country.
